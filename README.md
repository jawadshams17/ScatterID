ScatterID is an open-source, decentralized, zero-knowledge identity verification infrastructure. It provides a reference framework for organizations to issue, anchor, and mathematically verify privacy-preserving digital credentials resilient against post-quantum cryptographic threats.

By combining **NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA-65)** post-quantum digital signatures, client-side **RFC 8785 (JCS)** canonicalization with cryptographic salting, and **Hyperledger Fabric** permissioned blockchain anchoring, ScatterID enforces strict data minimization: raw identity attributes never leave the client device.

---

## Architectural Highlights

* **Post-Quantum Digital Signatures (NIST FIPS 204):** Implements ML-DSA-65 (formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium3) lattice-based digital signatures to secure credentials against quantum computing cryptanalysis (Shor's algorithm).
* **Zero-Knowledge Data Minimization:** Raw claim data is canonicalized locally and salted with a 16-byte CSPRNG secret. Only a one-way `SHA3-256` commitment is ever transmitted to the network. ScatterID never stores, processes, or logs plaintext identity attributes.
* **Immutable Blockchain Anchoring:** Cryptographic proof commitments and revocation states are permanently anchored to a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric ledger with Raft consensus.
* **Standalone Offline Verification:** Verifiers and auditors can validate credentials air-gapped without internet access or blockchain connectivity using zero-dependency CLI tools.
* **Turnkey Single-Command Provisioning:** Complete microservice topology (Vault KMS, PQC Crypto Microservice, Verification Gateway, Fabric Consortium, and Web Diagnostics Console) initializes out of the box with zero manual configuration.

---

## Quickstart

ScatterID runs on standard Linux and macOS environments with **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jawadshams17/ScatterID.git
cd ScatterID

# 2. Launch the turnkey stack (provisions keys, mTLS certificates, ledger, and services)
./scripts/quickstart.sh
```

### Operational Profiles
* **Core Microservices & Operations Console (`./scripts/start.sh` or `docker compose up -d`):**  
  Launches core microservices (PQC Crypto Engine, Verification Gateway API, Hyperledger Fabric ledger, HashiCorp Vault) along with the Zone 2 Operations Console (`:8080`) and Zone 1 Help Desk Client Portal (`:5000`).

---

### Local Service Endpoints
| Service | Endpoint | Network Zone | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operations Console** | `http://localhost:8080` | Zone 2 (`10.10.0.10`) | Appsmith dark-slate executive console (Moderator review & Root authority execution) |
| **Help Desk Client Portal** | `http://localhost:5000` | Zone 1 (`10.20.0.10`) | Front-counter clerk intake portal (4-point checklist, WebCrypto SHA-256, verify/revoke desk) |
| **Verification Gateway API** | `http://localhost:3000` | Zone 3 (`10.30.0.11`) | REST API for credential issuance, verification, and revocation |
| **PQC Crypto Service** | `https://localhost:5001` | Zone 3 (`10.30.0.10`) | High-security ML-DSA-65 signing engine (internal mTLS) |
| **HashiCorp Vault KMS** | `http://localhost:8200` | Zone 3 (`10.30.0.20`) | Key management service holding post-quantum keypairs |

## Ecosystem Architecture & Multi-Repository Structure

The ScatterID platform is structured across three complementary repositories forming the complete sovereign identity ecosystem:

| Repository | Scope / Role | Port / Network Zone | Automated Test Coverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`ScatterID`](.)** (This Repo) | Core PQC Crypto Engine, Verification Gateway API, Fabric Ledger, and **Operations Console** (`components/ops-dashboard`) | `:3000` (Core API)<br>`:5001` (PQC Engine)<br>`:8080` (Ops Console / Zone 2) | 12 core suites + 117 console tests (100% pass) |
| **[`ScatterID-app`](../ScatterID-app)** | **Help Desk Client Portal**: Front-counter clerk interface for in-person document inspection (4-point checklist), digital scan intake (WebCrypto SHA-256), Level 1/2 verification desk, and revocation docket intake | `:5000` (Counter Desk / Zone 1) | 35 automated full-flow tests (100% pass) |
| **[`ScatterID-web`](../ScatterID-web)** | **Documentation & Developer Portal**: Next.js public documentation, RFC references, and cryptographic interactive explorer | `:3001` (Public Web / DMZ) | Static build & lint verification |

### Running the Ecosystem Services
```bash
# 1. Start core microservices + Operations Console (Zone 2 & 3)
cd ScatterID
docker compose up -d

# 2. Start Help Desk Client Portal (Zone 1)
cd ../ScatterID-app
npm install && npm start # Serves on http://localhost:5000
```

---

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run all unit, parity, mutation, fuzzing, ops-dashboard, and client-portal test suites:
./tests/run_all_unit_tests.sh
```

---

## Standalone Offline Verification

Auditors and relying parties can mathematically validate any issued credential **100% offline** without network access or blockchain dependencies:

```bash
# Node.js Verifier (zero external dependencies)
# Validates RFC 8785 canonicalization, salting, SHA3-256 pre-image commitment (Level 1),
# and inspects ML-DSA-65 container structural dimensions (3309B signature / 1952B public key).
node tools/verify_offline.js <path-to-credential.json> [--public-key <hex>]

# Python Verifier (requires liboqs-python)
# Executes complete cryptographic Level 2 ML-DSA-65 post-quantum signature verification
# against the issuer's public key.
python3 tools/verify_offline.py <path-to-credential.json> [--public-key <hex>]
```

### Verifier Capabilities & Cryptographic Boundaries
| Runtime | Pre-Image Commitment (Level 1) | Container Structural Check | Mathematical ML-DSA-65 (Level 2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Node.js (`verify_offline.js`)** | Verified (RFC 8785 + SHA3-256) | Verified (3309B Sig / 1952B PK) | Requires liboqs (delegates to Python CLI) |
| **Python (`verify_offline.py`)** | Verified (RFC 8785 + SHA3-256) | Verified (Binary parsing) | Verified (NIST FIPS 204 via liboqs) |

> [!NOTE]
> **Offline Freshness Limitation**: Offline verification mathematically proves authenticity and integrity at the time of issuance; it cannot confirm whether the credential has since been revoked on the blockchain ledger without querying the network.

Cross-language parity is asserted across both verifiers via `./tests/offline_verify_parity.test.sh`.

## About the Creator

ScatterID is designed and built by **Jawad Shams** (`jawadshams17`), a cybersecurity graduate focused on security architecture, applied cryptography, and turning standards-track research (like NIST's post-quantum signature schemes) into deployable systems. This project is the technical centerpiece of that focus — an end-to-end reference architecture rather than a single algorithm demo, covering key management, service topology, offline verification tooling, and operational documentation.
