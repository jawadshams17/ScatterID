### 1. 🚀 Start Here
Essential guides for getting started, running the stack locally, and understanding the core value proposition:
* **[Setup and Usage Guide](SETUP_AND_USAGE.md)** — Step-by-step local provisioning, container orchestration, environment configuration, and verification.
* **[High-Level Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)** — Executive architectural diagram, microservice topologies, and sequence flows.
* **[01. Strategy & Product Specification](01-strategy-and-product.md)** — Problem statement, market landscape, user personas, and product roadmap.

---

### 2. 🧮 Architecture & Cryptography
Deep-dive mathematical models, PQC signature schemes, and ledger anchoring:
* **[02. Architecture & Technical Design](02-architecture-and-technical-design.md)** — Microservice specifications (Crypto Service, Verification API, Vault KMS, Hyperledger Fabric).
* **[03. Cryptography Specification](03-cryptography-specific.md)** — NIST FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 implementation, RFC 8785 canonicalization, CSPRNG salting, and SHA3-256 commitments.

* **[05. CI/CD & DevOps Pipeline](05-cicd-and-devops.md)** — Automated test execution, security scans (Gitleaks, CodeQL, pip-audit, npm audit), and container builds.

---

### 4. 🛡️ Security & Quality Assurance
Threat modeling, cryptographic boundaries, test suites, and audit logging:
* **[06. Security Engineering](06-security-engineering.md)** — Threat vectors, timing-safe authentication, mTLS encryption, Vault KMS hardening, and audit logging.
* **[07. Testing & Quality Assurance](07-testing-and-qa.md)** — Unit test coverage, integration tests, offline verification parity test suite, and live ledger tests.
* **[Root Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)** — Vulnerability reporting guidelines, API key tier definitions (`VERIFICATION_API_KEY`, `REVOKE_API_KEY`), and supported versions.

---

### 5. 📜 Compliance, Governance & Client Integration
Legal compliance, development guidelines, and customer onboarding:
