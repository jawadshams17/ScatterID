# ScatterID - Strategy & Product Documentation

## Product Requirements Document

### Problem Statement

Identity data is permanent, but the cryptography protecting it is not. Passwords and API keys can be rotated after a breach; a fingerprint, a national ID number, or a KYC record cannot. Most identity systems rely on classical cryptography (RSA/ECC) and centralized storage — both are vulnerable to "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, where data stolen today becomes exploitable once quantum computers mature, and to single-point breaches, where one compromised server exposes a complete credential.

### Goals

1. Issue and verify identity credentials signed with NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (ML-DSA-65)
4. Run on our own private, permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) for tamper-evident anchoring — fully self-owned infrastructure, no third-party chain dependency
5. Provide a working SDK that a third-party developer can integrate in under a day
6. Validate the approach with at least one real design-partner pilot (target: a university or small KYC vendor) within the roadmap's Phase 3

### Non-Goals (v1)

- Building a custom Layer-1 blockchain or consensus mechanism — Hyperledger Fabric is used as-is, not extended or replaced
- Full zero-knowledge selective disclosure — lattice-based ZK proofs remain a Phase 4+ research track
- Fuzzy/biometric matching (fingerprint, face) — genuinely open research territory; v1 targets exact-match identity data only (IDs, KYC status, credential claims, document hashes)
- Consumer-facing wallet or mobile app — v1 is B2B infrastructure (SDK + API), not an end-user product
- Public mainnet deployment — v1 runs on our own private, permissioned network

### Core User Stories



**As a business evaluating this product**, I want confidence that no homegrown cryptography is involved — only audited, standardized libraries — so that I can defend this choice to my own compliance/security team.

### Requirements

**P0 (Must-Have):**
- PQ-signed credential issuance (ML-DSA-65 via liboqs)
- Anchoring on our private Hyperledger Fabric network
- Basic audit logging

**P1 (Should-Have):**
- JS/Python SDK
- Sample integration app
- Developer documentation site
- Guardian-based recovery flow for lost access

**P2 (Future):**
- Zero-knowledge selective disclosure
- Fuzzy-matching/biometric support (separate research track)
- Mobile SDK
- Multi-chain anchoring options

### System Requirements by Layer

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Issuance Layer | Accept credential claims, hash (SHA3-256), sign (ML-DSA-65) | Never stores raw PII — hashes and claims only |
| Anchoring Layer | Write proof hash to private Fabric network | Tamper-evident, timestamped, no identity data on-chain |

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Private, permissioned blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric, deployed in three phases — (1) local process/port, (2) containerized/local network, (3) cloud-hosted with public IP and node-to-node TLS
- **Cloud hosting for API/backend:** Any major provider, but deployment fully controlled by us — rented compute, owned configuration

### Success Metrics

**Leading:**
- Time for a new developer to complete first successful SDK integration (target: under 1 day)
- Number of credentials issued/verified in pilot (target: 500+ in first pilot)

**Lagging:**
- Design partner converts pilot into a paid or renewed engagement

### Open Questions

- Exact k/n values for production — default is k=3/n=5 for MVP; revisit based on pilot partner's fault-tolerance and security requirements
- Data residency/compliance constraints once handling a real customer's data — requires legal review once a specific pilot is identified
- Which cloud provider(s) host Phase 3 nodes — single provider (simpler) vs. multi-provider (stronger fault-tolerance story) — decide before Phase 3 begins

### Change Log

This version supersedes the initial PRD draft. Key updates:
- Locked Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain framework (previously unspecified)
- Locked ML-DSA-65 and Zero-Knowledge Verification (previously listed as "recommended")
- Refined target customer ranking based on sales-cycle friction

## Vision & Roadmap

### Vision Statement


**Long-term vision:** Become the default identity-verification infrastructure layer that KYC providers, universities, and fintechs plug into instead of building their own — the way payment processors became the default layer for online payments.

### Mission


### Why Now

- NIST finalized post-quantum cryptography standards (FIPS 203/204/205) — the algorithms are no longer experimental, they're standardized and implementable today
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" is an active, documented threat — data stolen today is already at risk from future quantum decryption
- Most quantum-safety efforts in the market target blockchain transactions/coins, not identity — identity remains an underserved, urgent gap

### Core Product Principles

2. Every signature is post-quantum from day one — no retrofitting later
3. We own our infrastructure (private blockchain, our own nodes) — no dependency on third-party chains for the security model to hold
4. Sell to businesses that verify identity claims, not consumers — B2B API/SDK, not a wallet app
5. Ship a narrow, real v1 before chasing every advanced feature (ZK proofs, biometrics) — credibility over hype

### Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 0 — Foundations | 4–6 weeks | PQC library selected, secret-sharing prototype, architecture locked (ADR), 3–5 customer conversations validating the problem |
| Phase 2 — Developer SDK | 6–8 weeks | JS/Python SDK, API docs, sample integration app, internal security review |
| Phase 3 — Cloud Deployment & Pilot | 8–12 weeks | Nodes deployed to cloud (Phase 3 of ledger rollout), one real design-partner pilot, case study |
| Phase 4 — Hardening & Growth | Ongoing | Third-party security audit, company registration finalized, begin sales to second/third customer, research track for fuzzy/biometric matching begins |

### What We Are Not Building (Yet)

- A custom Layer-1 blockchain consensus mechanism — using Hyperledger Fabric, not inventing our own
- A consumer-facing wallet or mobile app
- Full zero-knowledge selective disclosure — research track, not v1

### Success Definition (12-Month Horizon)

- Working MVP deployed on our own cloud-hosted private blockchain (Phase 3 of ledger rollout)
- At least one paying or committed pilot customer using the SDK in a real integration
- Company formally registered, core team + intern-built modules integrated into one stable product
- A credible security review/audit completed — not just claimed

## Market & Competitive Analysis

### Market Context

Post-quantum cryptography adoption is accelerating across the blockchain and security industries following NIST's finalized standards. Most current activity is concentrated on protecting blockchain transactions and coin custody — quantum-safe signature schemes for wallets, consensus, and transaction validation. Identity-specific post-quantum infrastructure remains comparatively underserved, with most relevant work still at the academic or early pilot stage rather than shipped, sellable product.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Description | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Project Eleven / similar PQC blockchain-security startups | Well-funded, protecting transaction/coin infrastructure | Not identity-focused — different problem, different buyer |
| Quranium, QRL | Building quantum-resistant base-layer blockchains | Infrastructure-layer plays, not identity-verification products — multi-year, well-funded efforts we shouldn't compete with directly |
| Stellar, Hedera, XRPL (PQC roadmaps) | Retrofitting PQC into existing large chains | General-purpose chains, not specialized identity infrastructure |

### Our Positioning

**⚠ Not another quantum-safe blockchain. The identity-verification layer nobody has shipped yet — built to be integrated by a business in days, not adopted as a new base-layer chain.**

**Differentiator 1:** Identity-specific, not general-purpose transaction security


**Differentiator 3:** Private, self-owned blockchain infrastructure — appeals to regulated buyers wary of public-chain dependency

**Differentiator 4:** Sellable now, via SDK/API, not a multi-year infrastructure bet requiring customers to migrate onto a new chain

### Market Risks

- **Larger, funded players could pivot** into identity-specific PQC once the space matures — our advantage is speed and focus, not resources
- **Enterprise/regulated sales cycles can be slow** — mitigate by targeting lower-friction first customers (universities, smaller KYC vendors) before large banks/governments
- **PQC standards and tooling are still maturing** — mitigate by using only NIST-finalized, audited libraries (liboqs/PQClean), never custom cryptographic implementations

### Why a Small Team Can Compete Here

- The gap is in a specific, narrow product (identity verification API), not in base-layer infrastructure — achievable without massive funding
- Using Hyperledger Fabric (proven, open-source, industry-accepted) means we're not competing on blockchain engineering — we're competing on the identity-verification product built on top of it

## Target Customer & Use Case

### Primary Target Segments (Ranked by Ease of First Sale)

| Rank | Segment | Why They Buy | Key Characteristics |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Universities / Credential Verification Bodies | Verify degrees, transcripts, certifications for employers/other institutions | Static, exact-match data; low regulatory complexity; fastest realistic first pilot |
| 2 | Small/Mid KYC Verification Vendors | Verify user identity for banks, fintechs, exchanges on behalf of clients | Directly liable for secure long-term storage of verification data — strong pain point match |
| 4 | Web3 Wallets / Exchanges | Want quantum-safe identity/KYC add-ons without building it themselves | Crypto-native audience — PQC + blockchain-anchoring pitch resonates naturally, faster technical buy-in |
| 5 | Enterprise HR / Employee Verification | Employee background check status, security clearance verification | Lower regulatory risk than KYC — good early, low-friction customer |
| 6 | Government / eID Pilot Programs | National ID systems, especially smaller/emerging programs | High credibility if landed, but slow sales cycle — not a first-customer target |
| 7 | Insurance Companies | Verify claims-related identity/document data without full storage liability | Good mid-term segment once product is proven |

### Explicitly Deprioritized (Not v1 Targets)

- Physical access control companies (fingerprint/door lock systems) — requires fuzzy/biometric matching, which is a research track, not core
- Consumer-facing apps — ScatterID is B2B infrastructure, not a consumer product

### Core Use Case (v1): University Credential Verification


**Process:**

1. University (issuer) submits a claim ("Student X earned Degree Y in Year Z") through ScatterID's SDK
2. Client SDK canonicalizes the claim (RFC 8785), generates a 16-byte random salt, and computes `dataHash = SHA3-256(Salt || CanonicalClaim)` locally
3. ScatterID signs the dataHash using NIST ML-DSA-65 post-quantum lattice signatures and anchors the proof on Hyperledger Fabric — tamper-evident, timestamped
4. Employer (verifier) queries the verification API with the claim and salt — receives a valid/invalid cryptographic response without raw data ever being stored on servers or ledger

### Core Use Case (v1, Alternative): KYC Status Verification

**Process:**

2. Any partner fintech/bank the user interacts with later can verify the KYC-approved status via the API — without needing the vendor to re-share raw ID documents each time
3. Reduces both the vendor's liability (less raw data re-transmitted) and the partner's exposure (never receives or stores the underlying documents)

### Buyer Persona Notes

**Who signs the contract:** Typically a CTO, Head of Security/Compliance, or Head of Engineering at the target organization — not a general business stakeholder.

**What they care about most:**
- Compliance defensibility ("can we prove we did the right thing if breached")
- Integration simplicity (SDK, not a migration project)
- Credible security claims (audited libraries, not homegrown crypto)

**What kills the sale:**
- Any hint of unproven/homemade cryptography
- Unclear liability in case of a breach
- An integration that requires migrating off their existing systems entirely rather than plugging in

## Pitch One-Pager

### The Problem

Identity data is permanent — a fingerprint, a national ID, a KYC record cannot be "rotated" like a password after a breach. Yet most identity systems still rely on classical cryptography and centralized storage. Attackers are already harvesting encrypted identity data today, betting they'll be able to decrypt it once quantum computers mature ("harvest now, decrypt later"). The most permanent, highest-value data is protected by the least future-proof security.

### The Solution


### Why Now

- NIST finalized post-quantum cryptography standards — implementable today, not experimental
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" is an active, documented threat to any data encrypted with classical cryptography
- Nearly all current post-quantum blockchain activity protects transactions and coins — identity remains an urgent, underserved gap

### How It Works (Simply)

1. **Issue:** A credential claim is hashed, signed with a post-quantum signature, and split into k-of-n shares
2. **Store:** Shares are distributed across independent nodes — losing one or two nodes doesn't lose the credential; compromising one node reveals nothing usable
3. **Anchor:** A tamper-evident proof hash is recorded on our private blockchain
4. **Verify:** A relying party checks validity through a simple API call — without ever needing the raw underlying data

### Who Buys This

- Universities & credential verification bodies (fastest first pilot)
- KYC verification vendors and fintechs (strongest compliance-driven pain point)
- Web3 wallets & exchanges (natural technical fit, faster buy-in)

### Business Model

B2B SDK and verification API, licensed per-verification or via subscription. No token, no coin — straightforward to sell, straightforward to explain to a compliance team.

### What Makes This Defensible

- Self-owned, private permissioned blockchain infrastructure (Hyperledger Fabric) — full control, no third-party chain dependency
- Built entirely on audited, open-source cryptographic libraries (liboqs/PQClean) — no homegrown cryptography, which is what security-conscious buyers actually check for

### Current Status

- Architecture and technical stack finalized
- Core team in place, structured internship program building out module components
- MVP in active development — phased rollout from local development through containerized testing to live cloud deployment
