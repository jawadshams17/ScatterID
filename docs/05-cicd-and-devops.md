## CI/CD Pipeline Design Document

### Pipeline Goals

- Catch bugs, lint failures, and security issues before human review, not after
- Make it impossible to merge code that breaks tests or fails security scans
- Automate deployment consistently across Phase 1 → 2 → 3, reducing manual deployment error

### Tooling

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CI/CD Platform | GitHub Actions | Free for open-source/small private repos, integrates directly with the GitHub org already in use |
| Container builds | Docker + GitHub Container Registry (or Docker Hub free tier) | Matches Phase 2/3 containerized deployment model |
| Secrets in CI | GitHub Actions encrypted secrets | Never hardcode credentials in workflow YAML files |

### Pipeline Stages (Per Module Repo)

```
on: pull_request → dev

1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies (cached)
3. Lint (per Coding Standards doc)
4. Run unit tests
5. Run SAST scan (see Security Testing Plan)
6. Dependency vulnerability scan (see Supply Chain Policy)
7. Build check (does it compile/build cleanly)

→ All must pass before merge is allowed (branch protection rule)
```

### Pipeline Stages (Integration Repo, Founders-Only)

```
on: push → integration

1. Pull latest from all module-sync branches
2. Run full unit test suites (all modules)
3. Run cross-module integration tests
4. Build Docker images for each service
5. Run container security scan (see Container Security Guidelines)
6. Deploy to staging environment (Phase 2 containerized network)

on: tag v*.*.* on main

8. Build production images
9. Deploy to production (Phase 3 cloud)
10. Post-deploy smoke test
11. Notify founders (Discord webhook) of deploy status
```

### Branch Protection Rules

- `main` and `dev`/`integration`: no direct pushes, PR required
- Required status checks before merge: lint, tests, SAST scan, dependency scan
- At least one approving review required (two for cryptographic-code PRs, per Code Review Checklist)

### Failure Handling

1. Any pipeline failure blocks merge automatically — no manual override without a founder's explicit sign-off, logged in the PR.
2. Flaky tests are treated as bugs to fix, not disabled/skipped — a skipped test is a silent gap in your safety net.
3. Security scan failures (SAST, dependency) are never silently ignored — triage each finding before deciding fix vs. accepted-risk, and document the decision either way.

### What CI Does Not Replace

- Manual code review — CI catches mechanical issues, not design or logic flaws
- Manual penetration testing — automated scans are a floor, not a ceiling
- Founder review of cryptographic code — no automated check substitutes for this per the Code Review Checklist

---

## Secrets Management Policy

### Scope

This policy covers all non-cryptographic-key secrets: API keys, database credentials, service tokens, CI/CD credentials. Signing key handling specifically is covered by the Key Management Policy — this document is broader operational secrets hygiene.

### Secret Storage by Environment

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Local development | .env files, never committed (.gitignore enforced) | Use .env.example with placeholder values as the committed template |
| CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | GitHub encrypted repository/organization secrets | Scoped per-repo where possible, not shared org-wide unless genuinely needed by all repos |
| Staging (Phase 2) | Docker environment variables injected at container runtime, sourced from a local secrets file excluded from version control | Acceptable for staging; not for production |
| Production (Phase 3+) | Dedicated secrets manager (cloud provider's secrets manager, or HashiCorp Vault) | Required — do not run production with only env-var secrets once real customer data is involved |

### Never-Commit Rules

**⚠ If a secret is ever committed to git history, rotate it immediately — removing it from a later commit does NOT remove it from history. Treat any committed secret as compromised, no exceptions.**

1. Every repo includes a .gitignore covering .env, *.pem, *.key, and any other credential file patterns before the first commit is made.
2. Use a pre-commit hook (e.g. gitleaks or truffleHog) to scan for accidentally staged secrets before they're committed.
3. CI pipeline includes a secrets-scanning step on every PR as a second layer of defense (see CI/CD Pipeline Design Document).
4. Never paste secrets into Discord, Slack, or any chat tool — including "temporarily" for debugging. Use the secrets manager's sharing mechanism instead.

### Access Control

- Interns never receive access to production or staging secrets — only to sandbox/testnet credentials scoped narrowly to their module (see module TODO docs).
- Founders hold access to production secrets; access is logged where the secrets manager supports it (most cloud secrets managers do by default).
- Rotate any secret immediately when a team member (founder or intern) with access to it leaves or is offboarded.

### Secret Rotation Schedule

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| API keys (customer-facing) | On suspected compromise; otherwise annually | Coordinate rotation with active customers to avoid breaking their integrations |
| Internal service credentials (DB, etc.) | On suspected compromise; otherwise every 6 months | Automate where the secrets manager supports scheduled rotation |
| CI/CD credentials | On suspected compromise; otherwise annually or on team member offboarding | Review who has access to modify CI secrets periodically |

### Incident Response — Secret Exposure

1. Rotate the exposed secret immediately — do not wait to assess impact first.
2. Audit logs/access history for any use of the secret during the suspected exposure window.
3. Document the incident (what, when, how detected, response taken) for the team's incident log.
4. If the secret was customer-facing, follow through on notification obligations per any applicable SLA or compliance requirement.

## Infrastructure as Code Documentation

### Why IaC for This Project

Given the phased rollout (local → container → cloud) and the requirement that node placement/security config be consistent and auditable (per the Network Topology document), infrastructure should be defined as code from Phase 2 onward — not manually clicked together in a cloud console. This also makes the "we own our infrastructure" pitch claim verifiable, not just asserted.

### Tooling Choice
- Ansible inventory files for production hosts should not be committed with real IPs/hostnames in a public or intern-accessible repo — keep infra repo access founders-only, consistent with the compartmentalization model used elsewhere.

### Change Process

1. Infrastructure changes proposed via PR against the infra repo, same as application code.
2. `terraform plan` output reviewed before any `apply` — never apply blind.
3. Founder review required for any change touching production or the Network Topology document's defined firewall/TLS rules.
4. After any infra change, update the Network Topology document if the change affects node placement, ports, or security controls — keep documentation and reality in sync.

### What Gets Provisioned Where

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 (local) | No IaC needed — manual local setup per Dev Environment Guide | Too small-scale to warrant automation overhead |
| Phase 2 (containerized) | docker-compose (not full Terraform) for local multi-container network | Terraform reserved for actual cloud resource provisioning, not local containers |

### Disaster Recovery Note

## Deployment Runbook

### Phase 1 — Local Deployment

1. Clone the relevant module repo(s).
2. Follow module README setup steps (language runtime, dependencies).
3. Start Fabric peer/orderer/CA as local processes bound to localhost, per Network Topology document Section 2.
4. Start the Verification API locally, pointed at the local Fabric instance.
5. Run smoke test: issue a test credential, verify it resolves correctly end-to-end.

*Purpose: fastest iteration for chaincode/logic development. Not representative of real deployment conditions.*

### Phase 2 — Containerized Deployment

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed.
3. Verify all containers report healthy (`docker-compose ps`).
5. Run full integration test suite against the containerized environment.

*Purpose: first real multi-node testing environment. This is the required checkpoint before any cloud deployment — do not skip to Phase 3 without passing Phase 2 fault-tolerance tests.*

### Phase 3 — Cloud Deployment

1. Confirm Terraform state is current: `terraform plan` against the production environment, review output.
2. Apply infrastructure changes: `terraform apply` (founders only, per Infrastructure as Code document access rules).
4. Verify TLS is correctly configured node-to-node (per Network Topology document Section 5) before opening any firewall rules.
5. Deploy application containers via the CI/CD pipeline's production deploy stage (see CI/CD Pipeline Design Document).
6. Run post-deploy smoke test against the live public API endpoint.
7. Monitor logs/metrics closely for the first 24 hours after any production deployment.

### Pre-Deployment Checklist (Every Phase 3 Deploy)

- [ ] All CI checks passed on the release tag
- [ ] Definition of Done criteria met for everything included in this release
- [ ] Secrets confirmed to be in the production secrets manager, not left in env-vars or Ansible plaintext
- [ ] Firewall rules reviewed against the Network Topology document's port reference table
- [ ] Rollback plan confirmed ready (see Rollback & Incident Response Runbook)

### Deployment Windows

Until a real pilot customer is live, deployments can happen any time. Once a pilot customer depends on uptime, establish a deployment window (e.g. outside customer's business hours) and communicate planned deployments in advance, consistent with any SLA agreed with that customer.

### Post-Deployment Verification

2. Check monitoring dashboards for anomalies (error rate spike, latency increase) in the 30 minutes following deploy.
3. Confirm the deployed version tag matches what was intended — verify via a version/health endpoint if the API exposes one.

## Rollback & Incident Response Runbook

### Severity Classification

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| SEV-1 — Critical | Data exposure, key compromise, credential forgery possible, system fully down for customers | Immediate response, all founders alerted, hotfix process (see Branching & Release Strategy) |
| SEV-2 — High | Partial outage, degraded verification accuracy, a single node compromised (but below threshold k) | Response within hours, not days |
| SEV-3 — Medium | Non-critical bug, performance degradation, no security or data impact | Normal release cadence fix |
| SEV-4 — Low | Cosmetic or minor issue, no functional impact | Backlog, fix in next regular release |

### Rollback Procedure (Application Layer)

1. Identify the last known-good release tag (per Branching & Release Strategy's versioning).
2. Redeploy that tag through the standard CI/CD deploy pipeline — do not manually patch production directly.
3. Verify rollback success with the same post-deployment smoke test used for normal deploys.
4. Communicate rollback to the team and any affected pilot customer, with a brief explanation and expected resolution timeline.

### Rollback Procedure (Infrastructure Layer)

1. Because infrastructure is defined in Terraform (see Infrastructure as Code document), infrastructure-level issues can often be resolved by reverting the infra repo to the last known-good commit and re-applying.
2. For Fabric-specific issues (e.g. a bad chaincode deployment), use Fabric's chaincode versioning to revert to the previous approved chaincode version rather than attempting a manual ledger edit — the ledger itself should never be manually altered.

### Incident Response Process (SEV-1 / SEV-2)

1. Declare the incident — whoever notices first alerts all founders immediately (Discord/phone, not just an async message that might be missed).
2. Contain: if key compromise is suspected, begin emergency key rotation immediately per the Key Management Policy — don't wait for full root-cause analysis first.
3. Assess: determine actual scope — which credentials, customers, or data are affected.
4. Communicate: notify affected pilot customers as soon as scope is reasonably understood — do not wait for a full postmortem before initial disclosure.
5. Resolve: apply the fix via the hotfix process (Branching & Release Strategy) or rollback (Sections 2-3 above), whichever is faster and safer.
6. Verify: confirm the issue is actually resolved with explicit testing, not just "it looks fine now."

### Post-Incident Review (Required for SEV-1/SEV-2, Recommended for SEV-3)

Within a few days of resolution, write a blameless postmortem covering:

- Timeline: when it started, when detected, when resolved
- Root cause: what actually went wrong, not just the symptom
- Impact: what/who was affected, and how severely
- What went well: what limited the damage or sped up response
- Action items: specific, owned, dated follow-ups to prevent recurrence — not vague "be more careful" notes

### Communication Templates

**Internal alert (Discord, SEV-1/2)**

"[SEV-X] <short description>. Detected at <time>. <name> is investigating. Updates every 30 min until resolved."

**Customer notification (if a pilot customer is affected)**

"We identified an issue affecting <specific scope> starting at <time>. <Brief, honest description — avoid over-promising resolution time before you're confident>. We will update you by <specific time>."

### Special Case — Suspected Node Compromise Below Threshold


---

## Container Security Guidelines

### Base Image Selection

- Use official, minimal base images (e.g. `python:3.12-slim`, `node:20-alpine`) — smaller images mean smaller attack surface and faster scans.
- Avoid `:latest` tags in production Dockerfiles — pin specific versions, consistent with the library version-pinning rule in the Cryptographic Design Document.
- Pull base images only from official/verified sources — never an unverified third-party image for anything handling cryptographic material.

### Dockerfile Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Run as a non-root user — add `USER appuser` after creating a dedicated non-root user, never run application processes as root inside the container
- [ ] Multi-stage builds — build dependencies and tools should not exist in the final runtime image
- [ ] No secrets baked into image layers — secrets are injected at runtime (see Secrets Management Policy), never via `COPY` or `ENV` in the Dockerfile itself
- [ ] `.dockerignore` configured to exclude `.env`, `.git`, and any local secret files from the build context
- [ ] Minimal installed packages — don't include debugging tools or unnecessary utilities in production images

### Example Hardened Dockerfile Pattern

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .

FROM node:20-alpine
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]
```

### Image Scanning

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Tool | Trivy (open-source, free) | Scans for known CVEs in base images and dependencies |
| When | On every image build in CI (see CI/CD Pipeline Design Document) | Catches vulnerable base images before they reach staging or production |
| Policy | Block deploy on any Critical/High severity finding without an explicit, documented exception | Medium/Low findings tracked but don't block — avoid alert fatigue on genuinely low-risk items |

### Runtime Security

- Set resource limits (CPU/memory) on all containers — prevents a single compromised or misbehaving container from starving others.
- Use read-only root filesystems where the application doesn't need to write to disk (`--read-only` flag or Compose equivalent).
- Never mount the Docker socket into a container unless absolutely necessary — doing so effectively grants root on the host.

### Fabric-Specific Container Notes

- Fabric peer/orderer containers should use the official Hyperledger Fabric images, version-pinned to match the ADR's locked Fabric version.
- MSP material (certificates) mounted as read-only volumes, never baked into the image itself.
- Separate containers per node role (peer, orderer, CA) — don't combine multiple Fabric roles into a single container, which would undermine the node independence assumed in the Threat Model and Secret-Sharing Specification.

### Secrets in Containers — Cross-Reference

Full secrets handling rules live in the Secrets Management Policy. The container-specific rule to remember: environment variables passed to a container are visible via `docker inspect` to anyone with host access — for production, prefer mounting secrets from a secrets manager as files with restricted permissions over passing them as plain environment variables where the orchestration platform supports it.

## Environment Configuration Guide

### Environment Overview

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| dev | Individual developer/intern local machines (Phase 1) | Test keys/credentials only; no real customer data ever |
| staging | Containerized multi-node network (Phase 2), or early cloud deployment | Mirrors production topology for realistic testing; still uses test/sandbox credentials |
| production | Cloud-hosted, public IP (Phase 3+) | Real customer data; full security controls required |

### Configuration Management Approach

- Environment-specific settings (URLs, node addresses, feature flags) live in environment variables, never hardcoded in application code.
- Each environment has its own `.env.example` template (committed) documenting required variables, and its own actual `.env` or secrets-manager entries (never committed).
- Configuration differences between environments should be minimal by design — the same codebase runs in all three; only config values change, not code paths, wherever possible (reduces "works in staging, breaks in production" risk).

### Required Environment Variables (Verification API, Example)

```bash
# .env.example
NODE_ENV=development|staging|production
PORT=3000
API_KEY_SECRET=<set via secrets manager in staging/prod>
FABRIC_PEER_ENDPOINT=<node address, differs per environment>
FABRIC_MSP_PATH=<path to MSP certs, differs per environment>
DATABASE_URL=<connection string, differs per environment>
LOG_LEVEL=debug|info|warn
```

### Environment-Specific Rules

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| dev | Verbose logging allowed (LOG_LEVEL=debug); test keys only; no real anchoring to any persistent chain (local Phase 1 instance only) | Optimized for fast iteration, not security |
| staging | Moderate logging; sandbox/testnet credentials; full Phase 2 multi-node topology for realistic testing | Should catch integration issues before they ever reach production |
| production | Minimal logging (no sensitive data, ever); production secrets manager; full TLS/firewall rules per Network Topology document | Any deviation from these rules requires explicit founder sign-off, logged |

### Promoting Changes Between Environments

1. Changes are developed and tested in dev first.
2. Merged changes deploy to staging automatically via CI/CD (see CI/CD Pipeline Design Document).
3. Staging is manually verified (smoke tests, and for larger changes, a founder review of behavior) before promotion.
4. Only tagged releases deploy to production — never a direct dev-to-production promotion, regardless of urgency (hotfixes still go through the abbreviated hotfix process, not around environment promotion entirely).

### Access Control by Environment

- **dev:** all team members and interns, scoped to their assigned module only
- **staging:** founders and track leads; interns may have read/observe access for testing their integrated module, but not deploy access
- **production:** founders only

### Data Handling by Environment

**⚠ Real customer data must never be copied into dev or staging for debugging purposes, even temporarily. Use synthetic/generated test data that mimics the shape of real data instead.**
